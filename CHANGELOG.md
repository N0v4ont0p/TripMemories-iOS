# TripMemories iOS - Changelog

## Version 1.1.0 - October 4, 2025

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### AttributeGraph Cycle Resolution
- **Fixed:** Eliminated AttributeGraph cycle error that caused crashes when switching between tabs
- **Changed:** MapView now uses `@EnvironmentObject` instead of receiving trips as a parameter
- **Impact:** Stable tab navigation with no crashes or infinite loops

#### Map View Stability
- **Fixed:** Map view crashes when returning to Trips tab
- **Added:** Proper lifecycle management with `hasInitialized` state
- **Added:** Comprehensive coordinate validation (-90 to 90 latitude, -180 to 180 longitude)
- **Added:** Graceful fallback to default world view when no trips exist
- **Added:** Smooth animations for region changes
- **Impact:** Reliable map functionality with better error handling

### üéØ Trip Detection Improvements

#### Algorithm Enhancements
- **Changed:** Reduced minimum trip distance from 50km to 30km (more sensitive)
- **Changed:** Increased location grouping radius from 100km to 150km (better clustering)
- **Changed:** Extended max day gap from 3 to 4 days (captures longer trips)
- **Added:** Nearby trip merge radius of 200km with time-based validation
- **Impact:** More accurate trip detection, especially for UK and US trips

#### Location Naming Improvements
- **Added:** Smart location naming based on home country
- **Added:** City + country code format for large countries (e.g., "London, UK")
- **Added:** Country code mapping (USA, UK, AUS, CAN, etc.)
- **Impact:** More descriptive and useful location names

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

#### iCloud Photo Loading
- **Added:** 10-second timeout per photo with proper cancellation
- **Changed:** Improved delivery mode from `opportunistic` to `highQualityFormat`
- **Added:** Progress handler for tracking iCloud download errors
- **Changed:** Increased batch size from 15 to 20 photos
- **Added:** Real-time progress tracking with percentage display
- **Added:** 0.1-second delay between batches to prevent system overload
- **Added:** `preloadThumbnails()` function for loading only visible photos
- **Impact:** Faster photo loading with better responsiveness

#### Memory Management
- **Added:** Weak self references in task groups
- **Added:** Proper request cancellation to free resources
- **Added:** Accepts degraded images on timeout (better than no image)
- **Impact:** Reduced memory usage and better resource management

2. Open the app (existing cache will be preserved)
3. Tap "Reorganize" to rebuild trips with the improved algorithm
4. Enjoy the enhanced stability and performance!

**What to expect:**
- More trips detected (especially shorter trips)
- Better location names
- Faster photo loading
- No more crashes when switching tabs
- Stable map view

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Features
- Manual trip editing (merge, split, rename)
- Custom trip covers
- Export trips as albums
- Share trips with friends
- Advanced filtering options
- Search functionality
- Timeline view

### Potential Improvements
